# üì¶ Intelligent Warehouse Management System Proposal  
**For Data Science & AI Course Project**

---

## üß† Overview

This project aims to build a **Warehouse Management System (WMS)** powered by **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to optimize inventory handling, reduce waste, and improve decision-making. The system will incorporate intelligent modules such as **demand forecasting**, **automated replenishment**, **inventory classification**, and **image-based fragility detection**.

---

## üîç Key AI-Driven Modules

### üìà 1. Demand Forecasting  
Forecast future product demand using AI to ensure optimal inventory levels.

#### How It Works:
- Utilizes **time-series analysis** and **machine learning** to model demand trends.
- Considers **seasonality**, **promotions**, **external market indicators**, and **historical purchase behavior**.

#### Benefits:
- Prevents **stockouts** and **excess inventory**.
- Improves **customer satisfaction** and **warehouse efficiency**.
- Enhances **cash flow** and **supplier coordination**.

### üîÑ 2. Automated Replenishment  
Restocks inventory using intelligent algorithms when items approach critical thresholds.

#### How It Works:
- Monitors real-time inventory levels.
- Applies dynamic reorder rules based on demand prediction and buffer stock.
- Integrates with backend systems like ERP and supplier APIs.

#### Replenishment Models:

| Model        | Description                                                              |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Min/Max      | Triggers reorder at defined lower thresholds.                            |
| Demand-Based | Reorders based on forecasted consumption trends.                         |
| Top-Off      | Refills stock during low-activity periods.                               |
| Periodic     | Reorders at regular time intervals regardless of stock movement.         |

#### Benefits:
- Reduces **manual error** and **labor cost**.
- Supports **just-in-time** inventory practices.
- Enables **scalable, hands-free operations**.

### üóÇÔ∏è 3. Inventory Classification  
Organizes items into intelligent categories for targeted stocking and monitoring.

#### Classification Techniques:

| Method | Focus                        | Example Categories                          |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| ABC    | Monetary value & turnover    | A (high-value), B (medium), C (low)          |
| XYZ    | Demand consistency           | X (stable), Y (variable), Z (erratic)        |
| FSN    | Movement frequency           | F (fast-moving), S (slow), N (non-moving)    |
| VED    | Operational importance       | V (vital), E (essential), D (desirable)      |

#### Benefits:
- Prioritizes high-impact items for detailed monitoring.
- Improves **layout design**, **staff efficiency**, and **forecast accuracy**.
- Lowers **holding cost** and **obsolescence risk**.

---

### üì∑ 4. Fragility Detection via Image Classification  
Detects whether items are **fragile** or **non-fragile** using deep learning models applied to product images.

#### How It Works:
- Uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** trained on labeled images.
- Applies **transfer learning** (e.g. MobileNet or ResNet) to identify fragile patterns like glass, ceramics, or electronics.
- Classifies uploaded or scanned images and tags items accordingly.

#### Data Sources:
- Supplier catalogs and product imagery
- In-house warehouse image captures
- Optionally augmented with metadata and IoT inputs

#### Benefits:
- Improves **storage logic** and **transport handling**.
- Enables **damage prevention protocols**.
- Reduces **returns and losses** due to mishandling.
- Facilitates **labeling and alerting** in real time.
